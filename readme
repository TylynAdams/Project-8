I haven't finished this. I was told that I had to have it turned in today and 
I've just run out of time to work on it.
I'm planning on working on it more on Monday when I have more time and try and 
figure out databases because those have been the hardest for me to understand.
I have honestly put a lot of work into these over the past week and a half, 
even though it might not look like it. It was just a lot for me and I couldn't
get it all done by the time I had to turn it in but I am going to continue 
working on them.
